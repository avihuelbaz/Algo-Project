# Algorithmic trading on the stock exchange:
In this project, I developed three methods for predicting stock market prices

## Method 1:
One of the well-known strategies in investing in the capital market is the momentum strategy, in this method we found the optimum for combining the following variables:
1. Number of shares
2. The period when stocks should be in momentum
3. For how long to invest in these stocks.

## Method 2:
In order to invest in the short term, we have developed a method on top of method 1, in this method we sell and buy the stock based on technical indicators

## Method 3:
This method was developed in machine learning methodologies across stock time series

# Project Initialization:
There is a small problem with installing ta-lib directory, please search online for it.
Beyond that for every strategy there is development both with and without a backtrader library

## Good luck!
